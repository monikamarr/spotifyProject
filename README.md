# spotifyProject
The project is a playlist generator. It takes a prompt as input and uses the OpenAI API to retrieve a playlist of songs that match the given prompt.
The process is straightforward: you provide a prompt through the terminal, such as "5 songs to listen to while feeling sad and heartbroken," 
and the tool generates a curated playlist for you.
